{
/*this class should enclose the 
 * parser and the functions 
 * 1. And ,or ,not ,xor,
 * 2. ones (x) : returns number of 1's in binary representation of x
 *  similar to ones, define functions like : 
 * zeros(x)
 * 3. firstOne(x) : returns location of first one log2(x&(-x))
 * 4. nearPower(x) : nearest power of x
 * 
 * Just implement these functions and after that, 
 * you need to provide the following functionality : 
 * 1. You need to parse what user has entered. 
 * 2. if user types "help" just dump all the commands available
 * 3. if user types exit, go to main screen ( for now ,exit the program)
 * 4. if user types a valid command , print result in the next line. 
 * eg : 
 * 		$help
 * 		$ ones : get number of ones in binary representaion
 *   ( the dollar will also be printed by your program)
 *
